    Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are often caught in the wild<br>
    but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water.<br>
    Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping.<br>
    "Fishing" may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, crustaceans,<br>
    and echinoderms (such as starfish and sea urchins).<br>
